              topmost hub for civil services aspirants all over the country.

              single minded purpose of cracking the civil services exam. A
              phenomenon that started years ago with a single institute called
              Vajiram & Ravi has transformed the area into the most sought after
              destination for the most bright, talented and gifted students from
              all across the country, turning it into a cosmopolitan,
              multi-ethnic melting pot teeming with aspirants full of hope and

            <p className="aboutLocDesc">
              Karol Bagh is a popular locality in Central Delhi and has always
              been well known for its markets and great food. In the last few
              years Karol Bagh has gained prominence as a much favoured
              destination for UPSC aspirants. The primary reason being its
              location right next to Old Rajinder Nagar. Located just across the
              road right opposite to Old Rajinder Nagar, most areas in Karol
              Bagh are equidistant from the top coaching institutes as those in
              Old Rajinder Nagar. Since the number of aspirants coming in every
              year is simply too high, naturally not all of them cannot get
              accommodation in Old Rajinder Nagar. Also because of the deluge of
              aspirants, the rental prices have also tended to go higher in
              Rajinder Nagar. Beacause of its location and the space constraints
              in Old Rajinder Nagar, a number of reputed UPSC coaching
              institutes have opened their centres in Karol Bagh. As you go for
              a quick walk in the area you will realise that a very large number
              of aspirants now reside in Karol Bagh. This had led to the
              proliferation of an entire ecosystem catering to the needs of UPSC
              aspirants. The area now boasts of a number of PGâ€™s and apartments,
              24x7 Libraries/ Reading Rooms, bookshops and restaurants and
              tiffin services catering to aspirants. Aspirants residing in Karol
              Bagh can enjoy a little more space comparatively, while being just
              2-5 minutes walk away from all major coaching institutes. In fact
              most students who prefer to rent out an apartment instead of a PG
              prefer Karol Bagh as the rental prices would be too high in
              Rajinder Nagar.
